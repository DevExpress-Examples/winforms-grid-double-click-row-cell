# Data Grid for Windows Forms - How to handle a double-click on a grid row or cell

This example shows how to respond to double-click mouse events within rows, cells, and cell editors in a [Grid Control](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/3455/controls-and-libraries/data-grid). The code demonstrates how to implement this task when cell edit operations are disabled and enabled.

The grid does not fire its own [DoubleClick](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraGrid.Views.Base.BaseView.DoubleClick) event when a user double-clicks within an active cell editor. This example shows how to intercept mouse double-click actions within cell editors.
