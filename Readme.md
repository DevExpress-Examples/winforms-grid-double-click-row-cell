# WinForms Data Grid - How to handle a double-click on a data row or cell

The [Grid Control](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/3455/controls-and-libraries/data-grid) does not fire the [DoubleClick](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraGrid.Views.Base.BaseView.DoubleClick) event when a user double-clicks within an active cell editor. This example shows how to intercept mouse double-clicks within cell editors (enabled or disabled) (to respond to double-click mouse events within the active cell editor, rows, and cells).
